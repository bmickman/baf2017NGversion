  The Bushwick Arts Festival (est 2016) is a freeform art crawl that allows any artist or art space to submit art-related events such as open studios.
  Artists are encouraged to show whatever they want without censorship, and transform their chosen space into their own personal creative universe.
  BAF is not big on mission statements.  Come party!
